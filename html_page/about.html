        <p>My name is Fabio A. Pollmeier and I am a 27 year old resident of Amsterdam, studying coding at winc academy </p>
        <p>I have been learning alot in terms of how websites are developed</p>
        <p>This whole process is compairable to learning a new language, which is highly useful in todays job market</p>
        <p>I hope to learn as much as I can and develop on my personal skills to be able to understand how web based systems work</p>
